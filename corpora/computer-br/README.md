# Computer-BR Corpus

The Computer-BR Corpus consists of 2,317 tweets that was extracted in the period from January 1st to September 18th, 2015.
The Corpus has 34,437 tokens and 4,653 types. To build it, we used keywords related to computers:
notebook, analysis, testing, and so on. We relied on 3 human annotators who defined the polarity of the tweets
in the hole process, and 1 in cases of disagreement. We consider 2 equal polarities to the final polarity.
It is worth mentioning that three annotators were from the Computer Science area and one from the Linguistics area.
The final kappa index was 0.69.
The annotation considered 4 classes:

1. Irony (-2)
2. Negative (-1)
3. Neutral (0)
4. Positive (1)

## Sentiments distribuition in the corpus.

|  Classes |  #Tweets(%)  |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| Irony    | 39 (1,7%)    |
| Negative | 404 (17,4%)  |
| Neutral  | 1667 (72,4%) |
| Positive | 197 (8,5%)   |

## Files

We use irony as negative in our study, but we give the two options.
