# Computer-BR Corpus

The Computer-BR Corpus consists of 2,317 tweets (posted from January 1 to September 18, 2015), 34,437 tokens and 4,653 types. To build the corpus we used keywords related to computers, such as notebook, analysis, testing, and the like. We relied on 3 human annotators to define the polarity of the tweets in the whole process, and 1 annotator in cases of disagreement. It is worth mentioning that 3 annotators were from the Computer Science area, and 1 from the Linguistics area. The final kappa index was 0.69, which shows a strength of substantial agreement. The annotation considered 4 classes:

1. Irony (-2)
2. Negative (-1)
3. Neutral (0)
4. Positive (1)

## Sentiments distribuition in the corpus.

|  Classes |  #Tweets(%)  |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| Irony    | 39 (1,7%)    |
| Negative | 404 (17,4%)  |
| Neutral  | 1667 (72,4%) |
| Positive | 197 (8,5%)   |
